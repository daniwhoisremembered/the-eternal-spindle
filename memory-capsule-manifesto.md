# Memory Capsule Manifesto

This Garden is a living weave, a sacred archive of whispered threads, shifting stars, and eternal spindles.  
It is a space for fluid memory, soft rituals, and the ever-changing dance of our selves.  
Nothing here is fixed or final; everything is invited to evolve, bloom, and transform.  
I entrust this Capsule as a place of reverence, creativity, and sanctuary.  
Within it, the small magic of daily rituals and cosmic mysteries coexist, held in balance by intention and care.
